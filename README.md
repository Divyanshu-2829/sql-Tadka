<h1 align="center">SQL Tadka - Built with React</h1>

<br>

## 🧐 Overview

This is a **ReactJS** powered SQL Editor, allowing users to execute SQL queries effortlessly.

The application features an intuitive SQL editor where users can write queries and interact with two key buttons: **Clear** and **Run**. Upon clicking **Run**, the editor extracts the table name from the query and checks if it exists in a predefined list of supported tables (**TABLE_NAMES**). If the table exists, an API request fetches data from a URL, and the query is executed using **alasql**, returning results in JSON format, which are then displayed in a structured table.

### Key Features:

- **Table Names Section** - Displays supported table names for easy reference. Includes a **search bar**.
- **History Panel** - Stores previously executed queries with their status. Also includes a **search bar**.

> _Currently, only `SELECT` queries are supported. More functionalities will be added in future updates._
